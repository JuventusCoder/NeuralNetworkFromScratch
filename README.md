# Neural Network From Scratch
In this project I have built a simple Neural Network using pure Numpy (no TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc).

## The scope of the project

In this project I have demonstrated the "behind the scenes" of a very simple Neural Network (two linear layers with ReLU and Softmax activations).
The purpose of the project is to demonstrate what happens "under the hood" in libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.
I have used the MNIST Digit Recognition Dataset as an example.

## What you could further do with it

Although the accuracy reached is more than 90%, feel free to make any improvements that you feel could push this model even further.
You could even test out the model's performance on other datasets as well!
